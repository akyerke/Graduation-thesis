My graduation thesis "Machine Learning Models in Water Level Prediction. A case study of Han River" for Seoul National University, Bachelor's Degree in civil and environmental engineering. This research paper presents a case study focused on flood prediction in the Han River, employing and comparing the mean squared error (MSE) of three different models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Time Series Forecasting Linear (LTSF Linear) models. The study utilizes historical data on water levels from monitoring stations along the Han River.
